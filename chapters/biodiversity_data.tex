% ===========================
% Biological Collections data
% ---------------------------

% Biological collections
% Biological collections such as herbaria and museums are a valuable source of biodiversity data.
% Many new species are discovered from collections samples \cite{Kemp2015}.
% Data collection is opportunistic.


% However, we still face the challenge of digitizing biodiversity data \cite{Hardisty2013}.


% Biological collections data coverage and completeness \cite{Funk1999}.
% Completeness: How much of data representing the real distribution of a species has actually been collected?
% \cite{Jacobs2017}
% Completeness of biodiversity databases \cite{Soberon2007}


% Describing and publishing digitized datasets
% Data description (metadata).
% Data publication (Darwin Core).

% Although information about the occurrence of specimen in regions is turning massive and freely available, users of such data must be aware of some inherent caveats, coming from how the context in which data was recorded. 
% Not all questions can be properly answered with such data, as there might be taxonomic, spatial,... biases.

%% As it is common practice for botanists to record each species once during field work, some important ecological attributes such as the species abundance are not to be directly inferred from such data. {check van Gemerden 2005, from Haripersaud2009}


% Biological collections are composed of aggregates of multiple biodiversity surveys, each recorded with particular methodologies
% Records sampled using distinct methodologies can be combined for optimizing data use \cite{VanGemerden2005}.

% Types of biodiversity data
% --------------------------

% Survey data (species checklists) -> examples: Catalogue of life
% Species occurrence data


% ===============
% Occurrence data
% ---------------

%% Characteristics of occurrence data?
%%   - Main assets of a occurrence record: taxon, location, datetime {Graham2004} -> for us, also collectors
%%     

%% What are applications of occurrence data?
%%   - Species Distribution Modeling
%%   - Discovery of new species (check Kemp2015 - Museums: The endangered dead. )

%% Sources of occurrence data?
%%   - Biological collections / Museums;
%%   - Crowdsourcing/citizen science projects;

%% Limitations and caveats
%%   - Biases: collector bias, taxonomic bias, geographic bias...

% ============
% Data quality
% ------------
% [Soberon2004]

% Data quality among collection records is uneven -> worse for large datasets and for datasets composed by multiple sources
% Procedures are needed for correcting problems

% Quality issues: 
%% Determination issues: many specimens are incorrectly identified;
%% outdated taxonomy;
%% georreferencing errors.

% Data fit for use

In order to make data fit for its intended use the analyst must perform data cleaning.

% =============
% Data cleaning
% -------------
%[Chapman2005a]

% Why do we need data cleaning? -> We must make data fit for its indended use

% Goal: improving data quality, removing or treating entries that are 

% Adopting standardized collectors names
% Checking collectors itineraries -> look for the spatial pattern of records by the collector

% Terms and Definitions
% ---------------------
Before delving into the characterization of biodiversity data we review the definitions of some domain-specific terms that will be used throughout this text. 
We specifically use definitions from the \textit{International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants} (ICN) \cite{McNeill2012}. This document outlines a set of rules and guidelines for scientifically naming and grouping plants, fungi and algae, consisting of a universally adopted reference by the botanical scientific community. Nomenclature best-practices for other groups of organisms are governed by other (though similar) documents.

\paragraph*{Taxonomy}
Within the domain of biology taxonomy is, in a general sense, the science of classification of organisms. 
Organisms are classified in a hierarchical system, where more specific groupings of organisms are nested within broader ones. 
For an analogy with sets theory, a taxonomic classification system can be thought as being similar to a hereditary (or pure) set, in that all members in a set are, recursively, also required to be sets. In our case, however, we allow the existence of non-set objects only in the lowest-level set, which is the most specific grouping of organisms a taxonomist can come up with.

\paragraph*{Taxonomic Rank.}
The taxonomic rank of a grouping of organisms is the level of the taxonomic hierarchy at which it is defined. The most relevant ranks adopted in botany (in descending hierarchical order) are \textit{Kingdom}, \textit{Phylum} (or \textit{Division}), \textit{Class}, \textit{Order}, \textit{Family}, \textit{Genus}, \textit{Species}, as stated in \textit{Art. $3.1$} of ICN.

\paragraph*{Species.}
Species is one of the taxonomic ranks organisms can be determined by professional taxonomists as belonging to. It is regarded to be a basic unit of taxonomic classification, although organisms can be further classified in lower-hierarchy taxonomic ranks (infraspecific ranks).
Differently from other ranks, the name of a species is composed using a binomial nomenclature system, in which the name of the genus it belongs to is appended to a \textit{specific epithet}.
Examples of species names are \textit{Caryocar brasiliense}, \textit{Myrcia guianensis}, \textit{Solanum lycocarpum}.

\paragraph*{Specimen.}
When botanists sample organisms in field they either collect part of the organism (\textit{e.g.} a branch of a tree), the entire organism (\textit{e.g.} the entire body of a weed) or multiple individuals of the same type (\textit{e.g.} a bunch of identical, very small-sized mosses). 
Any of these collected biological materials is an evidence of the existence of a particular organism at some place and time, and should be properly deposited in a biological collection. A specimen is defined as one of such evidences, and refers to a punctual observation of a single kind of organism. For the formal definition refer to \textit{Art. $8.2$} of ICN. 
Although a specimen could be classified by a taxonomist as being a representative of a given species, this is not a requirement for them to be included in scientific collections. Although taxonomists classify specimens in a best effort manner (the most taxonomically precise as possible), sometimes only higher ranks can be determined. The highest taxonomic rank at which the specimen could be identified is known as its \textbf{taxonomic resolution}.
After properly deposited in a biological collection, each record receives a taxonomic identification that assigns the individual to a taxonomic group (a taxon), in a best-effort manner.

\paragraph*{Taxon.}

A taxon is a taxonomic group of organisms at the level of any rank (ICN \textit{Art.1.1}). Notice that the plural is \textbf{taxa}.
