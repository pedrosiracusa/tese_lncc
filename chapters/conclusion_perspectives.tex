\chapter{Conclusion and Future perspectives}\label{conclusion_perspectives}


% ===========
% Conclusions
% -----------



We show that modeling biological collections formation by focusing on the interests and relationships between collectors can be insightful for uncovering hidden mechanisms leading to the current composition of the herbarium. 


We could additionally model networks of species and determiners, similarly to what we've present for species and collectors.

% ============
% Perspectives
% ------------


% Including the temporal dimension
% Observers' perception is liable to change over time, being influenced by factors such as his/her own interests, motivations, age in career, available resources and location of residence.


% Including the spatial dimension
% The study of collectors carreer trajectories cite{Borgatti2015, conclusion} depends on incorporating temporal and geographic dimensions.


% Adopting an unifying structure
% SCNs and CWNs should be stored in an unified structure, for example using the structure of multiaspect graphs (MAGs).
% MAGs allow representing edges composed of multiple features by using general graph theory, instead of tensor algebra.
% Important dimensions can be included as aspects, such as temporal and spatial, and different types of edges. 





% ============
% Applications
% ------------


% Collectors Profiling and activities history
% -------------------------------------------
% Profiling collectors in terms of their activities and interests can be a way of further detecting anomalies (activity monitoring, Fawcett and Provost 1999).


% Building Recommender Systems
% ----------------------------
% Collaborative filtering: The system gather information about the interest of the collectors and then proposes collectors to record new species based on the interests of others.


% Link prediction

% Use Case: "From your collection activity pattern, you might be interested in collecting groups {} in places {}...we found a gap there. Why don't you contact team {}? They have extensively collected other groups in that location and are willing to collaborate in field. Otherwise you could contact land owner {}. His property is within that are and his renting fee is {} reais."

% Sampling Site Recommendation
% Objectivelly priorizing regions and taxa for surveys cite{Graham2004}, site selection cite{Funk2002}
% Sampling site priorization may be done based on niche models {Raxworthy}
