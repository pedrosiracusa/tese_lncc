% Building Recommending Systems
%% Collaborative filtering: The system gather information about the interest of the collectors and then proposes collectors to record new species based on the interests of others.

% Perspectives

% ============================
% Sampling Site Recommendation
% ----------------------------
% Objectivelly priorizing regions and taxa for surveys {Graham2004}, site selection{Funk2002}
%% Sampling site priorization may be done based on niche models {Raxworthy}
%% GDMs {Ferrier: Mapping Spatial Pattern in Biodiversity for Regional Conservation Planning: Where to from Here?}

% Recommender System - Use Cases:
%% "From your collection activity pattern, you might be interested in collecting groups {} in places {}...we found a gap there. Why don't you contact team {}? They have extensively collected other groups in that location and are willing to collaborate in field. Otherwise you could contact land owner {}. His property is within that are and his renting fee is {} reais."
