%%% Models predict species occurrence based on environmental features
%%% We need to understand which are the most relevant factors driving species' distribution
%%% Species distribution in geographic space is inferred from relevant relationships discovered in environmental space
%%% Explain the term and equivalence to Species Distribution modeling
%%% Do SDMs model potential or realized niche?
%%% Why bother modeling instead of creating maps based on point interpolation?

In this work we propose two network models for representing biological collections in terms of their

We base our argument for investigating the  a social network-based understanding of biological collections on the fact that natural history museums do not represent biodiversity within its scope


[...] 
However, biological collections do not necessarily equally represent biodiversity within its actuation scope.
Instead, in its best efforts, it reflects the perception and interests of people who have most contributed to it in terms of specimen records.
An observer's perception itself is liable to change over time, being influenced by factors such as his/her own interests, motivations, age in career, available resources and location of residence.
Moreover, an observer's perception is also influenced by the perception of others in their own communities, with whom the observer interact.
The composition of perceptions of all observers that contribute to a biological collection, summed up with data limitations and quality issues is what best characterizes the collection.

%% Premiss: Argue that a natural history museum dataset does not represent the biodiversity in its actuation area. Instead, in its best efforts it reflects the perception of people interested in studying it. An observer's perception itself is dynamic, being influenced by factors such as his/her own interests, motivations, age in career, available resources and residence. In other words, the perception varies temporally. Moreover, an observer's perception is also influenced by the perception of others in their own communities. The ensemble of perceptions of all observers that are part of a NHM, summed up with data limitations and quality issues is what best characterizes the collections.
%% This premiss holds similar for crowdsourcing data (citizen science)


%% One goal is to use occurrence data with collectors' ... Close to a map of distribution an expert would draw.
