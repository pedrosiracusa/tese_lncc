% Threats to biodiversity and public policies
As a side effect of global environmental changes associated to the rapid growth of the human population, we currently face an alarming scenario of biodiversity loss, as species are disappearing at rates that by far exceed natural extinction rates \cite{Ceballos2015}.
In fact, extinction rates observed for the last century stand out similarly to the $5$ previous events of mass extinctions (Ordovician-Silurian, Late Devonian, Permian-Triassic, End Triassic, and Cretaceous-tertiary), with strong evidence that the current will turn out to be the $6th$ one \cite{Wake2008}.
Among the main types of known threats to biodiversity are climate change, habitat loss and biological invasion, all of which associated to human activities \cite{Wilcove1998}.


% Mitigate threats
In face of this alarming scenario, understanding how environmental factors affect natural communities has been a central concern in ecology and biodiversity conservation research.
Advances in this directions are not only fundamental for improving scientific understanding on the mechanistic aspects of environmental impacts, but also for supporting environmental-related decision-making, allowing us to elaborate more effective plans for mitigating the impacts of human activities on natural systems.
Moreover, not all species are equally susceptible to the same cateogries of threats, and thus successful conservation efforts should prioritize those that are more sensitive to threats they experience, besides more genetically and ecologically relevant.
This involves considerating several species-specific aspects, including those related to life-history traits (\textit{e.g.} generation length), the sizes and dynamics of the populations and the extension of their geographical distributions \cite{iucn_categ_crit}.

% Nualart2017: Brings examples of nhc data uses for conservation
% Graham2004: section: application of spatial analysis of NHC for conservation assessment and planning
% Others: Soberon2004, Peterson2002a
In this context, biological collections (here used as a synonym for natural-history collections (NHC)) stand as fundamental sources of biodiversity information, as they hold physical exemplaries that testify the existence of organisms in both temporal and geographic spaces.
% Document biodiversity
Besides supporting conservation applications, biological collections have potentialized the discovery of new species \cite{Kemp2015}.

%In practice however, we often lack a thorough knowledge on many of those aspects.
%We are often compelled to work with very limited knowledge.
%One difficulty, however, is that we must take scientific-iinformed decisions even with very limited knowledge on the ecology, the diversity and the distribution of organisms on Earth.
%We also lack a thorough scientific understanding on the factors and processes that lead to the geographical distribution of species.
%Despite, we still need to take scientific-informed decisions in order to mitigate the impact of human activities on the environment and biodiversity \cite{Dozzier_4paradigm_2009, Funk1999}.
%Biodiversity informatics provides an evidence-based approach for understanding some of those aspects, based on data.

% Big data in Biodiversity
Currently, in the era of Big Data, there's a massive amount of biodiversity data available. 
The term Big Data refers to the fact that data is being produced in a rate that makes its processing a challenge.
A great variety of devices producing data in large scales.
A variety of low-cost sensors and cheap storage facilitate data collection, while reducing costs.
Information about the occurrence of specimen in regions is turning massive and freely available,
Biodiversity data comes from diverse sources, each of them with their own particularities (varied structures, sampling methods...).
Data collection can be opportunistic or use experimental designs (such as grids).
Currently, with the advent of open-science, researchers and institutions are becoming more willing to share their datasets. 
Many initiatives supporting open-science like GBIF\footnote{\url{gbif.org}} \cite{gbif} and DataOne are scientific biodiversity data aggregators, and help institutions publishing their datasets using best practices and standards. % how many records in gbif?
Such institutions are providing open access to biodiversity data.



Data is increasingly being made available
However, we still need to take information from it
% Biodiversity informatics
Biodiversity informatics provides an evidence-based approach for understanding some of those aspects, based on data.
The application of information technologies for managing, exploring, analyzing and interpreting primary biodiversity data has led to the rise of the field of Biodiversity Informatics \cite{Soberon2004}.
Typically, primary biodiversity data that is useful for biodiversity informatics studies concern specimens occurrence records.
There are costs associated to collecting new biodiversity data.
We need to be able to use biodiversity data that is already available the best as we can, taking as much information as possible from data that is already available.

% SDM for wildlife management
% Newbold2010
Concerned on identifying the most relevant environmental features driving the distribution of species, Species Distribution modeling (SDM) is one application that often uses biodiversity informatics.
These models predict the geographical distribution of species based on environmental features, such as temperature, precipitation, terrain declivity, among others.
Species distribution in geographic space is inferred from relevant relationships discovered in environmental space.
Species occurrence data is used in SDM for model fitting. 
SDMs allows us to project maps of probable occurrence of species.
Thus we can prioritize areas for allocating resources for wildlife conservation (priority areas selection).
Priority areas selection. %[ check Schulman 2003: Nature conservation in Amazonia: the role of biological theory in reserve delimitation – Conserv- acio´n de la naturaleza en la Amazonı´a]
Current challenge on Species Distribution Modeling include obtaining a sufficient amount of data with sufficient quality \cite{Araujo2006}.




% Citizen science in Biodiversity
A large amount of biodiversity data has also been collected by citizen scientists. 
Citizen are regarded as "live sensors".
We refer the practice of collecting large ammounts of data with the help of groups of people (paid or unpaid) as crowdsourcing.
Citizen science allow sampling much more extense are without spending resources.
Another benefit is that citizens gets involve in scientific endeavor.


% Knowledge from data
However, simply gathering and publishing large amounts of data per se is not sufficient.
One of the main challenges is how we transform a massive amount of messy data into valuable knowledge.
Data is useless unless it can be used for some purpose.
For instance, in order to be useful data needs to be properly organized and validated before being published.
Data life cycle is used for transforming biodiversity data into knowledge \cite{Michener2012}
Data life cycle includes (i) data management planning; (ii) data collection; (iii) data quality assurance and control (using standards and validation methods); (iv) data description, with metadata; (v) data preservation; (vi) data discovering; (vii) data integration; (viii) data analysis. 


% Big data challenge: Data-intensive analysis
Given the challenges concerning the complexities of biodiversity data, new approaches are needed for
We need new approaches for analyzing data, which is currently freely available in massive amounts.
Ecology is becoming a data-intensive science, and thus requires the adoption of data-driven approaches, in addition to more traditionally hypothesis-based approaches \cite{Kelling2009}.
More traditionally, ecology is more hypothesis-driven, as an investigator states hypotheses a priori from her own knowledge, and expects certain patterns to be observed in data she collects.
A data-driven approach, on the other hand, seeks to unravel relevant patterns from data, which can then be used for generating domain-specific hypotheses.
Data-intensive science gives us the opportunity of studying natural systems, which are inherently complex, more thoroughly.


% Big data challenge: Data bias
Another issue is data bias, which arises when records are not obtained from random sampling \cite{Daru2017}
Using biased data can impact the quality of models built on it \cite{Newbold2010}.
Data from biological collections (or museum data) is often biased \cite{Daru2017}.
Biological collection data is typically collected in clustered areas (collection centres) with very high collecting effort, and clusters are scattered \cite{Nelson1990, VanGemerden2005}.
Many algorithms for building SDMs assume data is randomly collected, and are thus particularly sensitive to biases \cite{Araujo2016} .
Maxent must be corrected for sampling bias.% check {Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie, et al. "The importance of correcting for sampling bias in MaxEnt species distribution models." Diversity and Distributions 19.11 (2013): 1366-1379.}\cite{Kramer-Schadt2013}
% Bias needs to be characterized, and accounted for.


% Biological collections representativeness
A biological collection does not necessarily represent well the biodiversity within its actuation regions \cite{Funk1999}.
Instead, in its best efforts it reflects the perception and interests of people who have most contributed to it in terms of specimens records.
An observer's perception itself is biased towards more attractive organisms. 
For instance, botanists tend to focus on flowering materials \cite{VanGemerden2005}.
Moreover, more experienced collectors tend to record species that are rare than common species, and thus common species are usually undersampled in collections \cite{Nelson1990}.
Moreover, an observer's perception is also influenced by the perception of others in their own communities, with whom the observer interacts. 
The composition of perceptions of all observers that contribute to a biological collection, summed up with data limitations and quality issues is what best characterizes the composition of collections.
Data users must be aware of some inherent caveats, coming from how the context in which data was recorded. 
This premiss holds similar for crowdsourcing data (citizen science)


% Our goal
We want to characterize collectors in terms of their taxonomic interests and collaborative interactions with other collectors.
We present two network models for modeling collectors interests and collaborative interactions in a biological collection.
We then expect to infer contextual information for each record based on the team of collectors who have authored it.
Thus we use network analysis for enriching biological collection datasets (Dataset contextual enrichment).
