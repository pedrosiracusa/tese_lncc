\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

% Threats to biodiversity and public policies
% We are currently losing biodiversity in high rates as an effect of human activities.
% However, we still know very little about the diversity of organisms and their distribution on earth.
% Climate change, land use (habitat loss) are examples of threats.
% We often lack a thorough scientific understanding of natural processes that lead to patterns of species geographical distribution.
% Biodiversity data that would be necessary for a thorough ecosystem understanding is often incomplete, unreliable or missing.
% There are costs associated to collecting new biodiversity data.
% Nevertheless, we still need to take scientific-informed decisions for mitigating the impact of human activities in the environment \cite{Dozzier_4paradigm_2009, Funk1999}.
% We need to use available biodiversity data the best as we can, taking as much information as possible from data that is already available.


% Biodiversity informatics
% The application of information technologies for managing, exploring, analyzing and interpreting primary biodiversity data has led to the rise of the field of Biodiversity Informatics \cite{Soberon2004}.
% Primary biodiversity data 


% SDM for wildlife management
% Species Distribution modeling (SDM) is one application that often uses biodiversity informatics. 
% Goal: identify relevant environmental features that are good predictors for the existence of species.
% Models predict the geographic distribution of species based on environmental features
% We need to understand which are the most relevant factors driving species' distribution
% Species distribution in geographic space is inferred from relevant relationships discovered in environmental space
% Species occurrence data is used in SDM for model fitting. 
% SDMs allows us to project maps of probable occurrence of species.
% Thus we can prioritize areas for allocating resources for wildlife conservation (priority areas selection).
% Current challenge on Species Distribution Modeling include obtaining a sufficient amount of data with sufficient quality \cite{Araujo2006}.


% Big data in Biodiversity
% Currently, in the era of Big Data, there's a massive amount of biodiversity data available. 
% The term Big Data refers to the fact that data is being produced in a rate that makes its processing a challenge.
% A great variety of devices producing data in large scales.
% A variety of low-cost sensors and cheap storage facilitate data collection, while reducing costs.
% Information about the occurrence of specimen in regions is turning massive and freely available,
% Biodiversity data comes from diverse sources, each of them with their own particularities (varied structures, sampling methods...).
% Data collection can be opportunistic or use experimental designs (such as grids).
% Currently, with the advent of open-science, researchers and institutions are becoming more willing to share their datasets. 
% Many initiatives supporting open-science like GBIF \cite{gbif} and DataOne are scientific biodiversity data aggregators, and help institutions publishing their datasets using best practices and standards.
% Such institutions are providing open access to biodiversity data.


% Citizen science in Biodiversity
% A large amount of biodiversity data has also been collected by citizen scientists. 
% Citizen are regarded as "live sensors".
% We refer the practice of collecting large ammounts of data with the help of groups of people (paid or unpaid) as crowdsourcing.
% Citizen science allow sampling much more extense are without spending resources.
% Another benefit is that citizens gets involve in scientific endeavor.


% Knowledge from data
% However, simply gathering and publishing large amounts of data per se is not sufficient.
% One of the main challenges is how we transform a massive amount of messy data into valuable knowledge.
% Data is useless unless it can be used for some purpose.
% For instance, in order to be useful data needs to be properly organized and validated before being published.
% Data life cycle is used for transforming biodiversity data into knowledge \cite{Michener2012}
% Data life cycle includes (i) data management planning; (ii) data collection; (iii) data quality assurance and control (using standards and validation methods); (iv) data description, with metadata; (v) data preservation; (vi) data discovering; (vii) data integration; (viii) data analysis. 


% Big data challenge: Data-intensive analysis
% We need new approaches for analyzing data, which is currently freely available in massive amounts.
% Moreover, ecology is becoming a data-intensive science, and thus requires the adoption of data-driven approaches \cite{Kelling2009}.
% More traditionally, ecology is more hypothesis-driven, as an investigator states hypotheses a priori from her own knowledge, and expects certain patterns to be observed in data she collects.
% A data-driven approach, on the other hand, seeks to unravel relevant patterns from data, which can then be used for generating domain-specific hypotheses.
% Data-intensive science gives us the opportunity of studying natural systems, which are inherently complex, more thoroughly.


% Big data challenge: Data bias
% Another issue is data bias, which arises when records are not obtained from random sampling \cite{Daru2017}
% Using biased data can impact the quality of models built on it.
% Data from biological collections (or museum data) is often biased \cite{Daru2017}.
% Biological collection data is typically collected in clustered areas with very high collecting effort, and clusters are scattered \cite{VanGemerden2005}.
% Many algorithms for building SDMs assume data is randomly collected, and are thus particularly sensitive to biases \cite{Araujo2016} .
% Maxent must be corrected for sampling bias: check {Kramer‚ÄêSchadt, Stephanie, et al. "The importance of correcting for sampling bias in MaxEnt species distribution models." Diversity and Distributions 19.11 (2013): 1366-1379.}\cite{Kramer-Schadt2013}
% Bias needs to be characterized, and accounted for.


% Biological collections representativeness
% A biological collection does not necessarily represent well the biodiversity within its actuation regions \cite{Funk1999}.
% Instead, in its best efforts it reflects the perception and interests of people who have most contributed to it in terms of specimens records.
% An observer's perception itself is biased towards more attractive organisms. 
% For instance, botanists tend to focus on flowering materials \cite{VanGemerden2005}.
% Moreover, more experienced collectors tend to record species that are rare than common species, and thus common species are usually undersampled in collections \cite{Nelson1990}.
% Moreover, an observer's perception is also influenced by the perception of others in their own communities, with whom the observer interacts. 
% The composition of perceptions of all observers that contribute to a biological collection, summed up with data limitations and quality issues is what best characterizes the composition of collections.
% Data users must be aware of some inherent caveats, coming from how the context in which data was recorded. 
% This premiss holds similar for crowdsourcing data (citizen science)


% Our goal
% We want to characterize collectors in terms of their taxonomic interests and collaborative interactions with other collectors.
% We present two network models for modeling collectors interests and collaborative interactions in a biological collection.
% We then expect to infer contextual information for each record based on the team of collectors who have authored it.
% Thus we enrich biological collection datasets (Dataset contextual enrichment).

% Overview of this document
% In chapter 2 we provide an overview of biodiversity data
% In chapter 3 we formally describe the network models, using the framework of graph theory.
% In chapter 4 we apply the network models for a case study of a real-world biological collection, the UB herbarium.
% In chapter 5 we present future perspectives to be achieved with the models here proposed.
