# Title
New perspectives into analyzing data from biological collections based on social network analytics

# Summary

Biological collections have been historically regarded as fundamental sources of scientific information on biodiversity, supporting a wide range of scientific and management initiatives in the scope of natural resources conservation.
As they are typically composed of specimens records - most of which derived from non-random and opportunistic sampling -, biological collections datasets are commonly associated to a variety of biases, which must be characterized and corrected for before they can be consumed in many of its applications.

Here we tackle taxonomic (or phylogenetic) and collector biases, which can be understood as the effect of particular recording preferences of key collectors on shaping the overall taxonomic composition of biological collections they contribute to.
We propose two models as the <fundamental stone> of a network-based conceptual framework for understanding the formation of biological collections as an emergent result of the composition of collectors' interests and activities.
Both models extend the well-established framework of social network analytics, benefiting from a whole set of metrics and algorithms for characterizing their topological features.

Species-collectors Networks (SCNs) model collectors' interests towards species, and are structured by linking collectors to each species they have recorded in the collection dataset. 
From complementary perspectives, SCNs allows one to investigate which collectors share interest in common sets of species; and conversely, which species are usually recorded by common sets of collectors. 

Collectors-coworking Networks (CWNs) are a special type of collaboration networks, structured from collaborative ties which form between collectors who record specimens together in field.
Such collaborative ties are created between pairs of collectors whenever they are both included as collectors in the same record.

One such application which is both extremelly relevant for wildlife management and specially sensitive to bias is Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), aiming to predict the geographic distribution of organisms based on environmental predictors.
Moreover, the overall taxononomic composition of biological collections heavily reflects the interests of the main collectors who have most contributed to it in terms of specimens records, and thus cannot be considered to accurately represent the composition of natural communities.



Another point to be investigated is how collectors collaboration in field influence their interest towards species groups. 


We also present a case study where we apply our models to explore the collectors composition of the UB herbarium at the University of Bras√≠lia.
Characterize the topology of the networks, pointing out relevant collectors and the main taxonomic groups of interest.
We also investigate collectors teams, by modeling CWNs.

Finally, we indicate some possible investigation directions that could possibly benefit from our modeling approach.
